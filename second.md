nobody asked for this but here's some politics stuff to help you 
lose your temper.


    Turkey is currently openly autocratic with a leadership that has repeatedly stated that they despise 
democracy, and they are running full speed towards a complete dictatorship. There is no point whatsoever in 
even pretending that talks are ongoing; Turkey will not qualify for membership in the next 25 years, 
even if they start democratic reform today.
Most of those people will be substantially poorer than Western Europeans and will have a great opportunity 
to migrate to and weigh down the social services of the west.
Turkey was on that path and making quite good progress for about 15 years but has recently backslid 
quite considerably. The failed coup and the crackdown have set Turkish EU membership back 10 years, maybe more.

Even the membership of the UK was questionable and disrupting to this balance before Brexit. Turkey with a 
population of 83 million will have equal or more seats in the EU parliament and other decision 
making organs than either of those two countries and potentially very disrupting to the existing 
balance of power within the EU. And on top of that all Eastern and Southern European members received between 
10–15.000 Euros/person financial aid to bring their economies/infrastructure in-line with the EU. The EU 
simply cannot pay this amount , between 850–1000 billlion Euros to Turkey. This is simply not possible.

According to the OECD, 60% or more of men work more than 45 hours per week. The shadow 
economy's ratio to the Turkish cross domestic product is at 28.72 percent. That would mean every 
third business is illegal. 
Turkey has set up a puppet state in Cyprus. Two years ago, the European Court of Human Rights 
(ECHR) ordered Turkey to pay Cyprus €90 million in compensation for invading the island, 
ethnic cleansing Cypriots and setting up a puppet state.
