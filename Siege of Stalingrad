Stretching about 30 miles (50 km) along the banks of the Volga River, 
Stalingrad was a large industrial city producing armaments and tractors and was 
an important prize in itself for the invading German army. The city 
would also serve
as a important prize for Hitler, encouraging morale in Germany.

Hitler wanted to destroy Soviet forces in the south, take control
of the region's resources, then he would mobolize his army to take Moscow or
conquer what was left of Caucasas. The offensive would be 
undertaken by Army Group South under Field Marshal Fedor von Bock.
