The Great Leap Forward 
of the now Communist Republic of China was 
an economic and social campaign led by the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) from 1958 to 1962. The goal of this plan was to 
outcompete Great Britain by 15 years, and demonstrate the manpower of
the communist country.

Between 1958 and 1960, millions of Chinese citizens 
were moved onto communes. Some were sent to 
farming cooperatives, while others worked in small 
manufacturing. Chairman Mao Zedong aimed to shift workers from
algricultural production to manufacturing sectors while also 
increasing China's output of products.

The basis of the commune system was that, agricultural and political 
decisions were decentralized, and ideological similarity rather 
than expertise was concentrated on. Everybody would share tools and tasks. 
The peasants were organized into 
brigade teams, and communal kitchens were formed so that 
women could add to the production. 

In communism,the ecomomy is controlled by the government, individuals
give their property to the state, so no person can be
wealthier than the other. Communism also uses a planned economy,
so workers are paid to do a certain amount of tasks every while.
Most workers are not motivated to give more input, so the 
economy does not work effectively.

The failure of agricultural policies, the movement of farmers 
from agricultural to industrial work, and weather conditions led to 
millions of deaths from severe famine. 
The economy, which had improved since the end of the civil war, 
was devastated, and in response to the severe conditions, 
there was resistance among the people.

From 1958 to 1962, Mao Zedong's Great Leap 
Forward policy led to the deaths of up to 45 million people- over twice as much
as the 20 million soldiers who died during World War II.
And for a while, the death rate in China was even higher than the birth rate.
The so called "Great Leap forward" was one of the most deadly 
famines in history.
