The Great Leap Forward 
of the now Communist Republic of China was 
an economic and social campaign led by the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) from 1958 to 1962. The goal of this plan was to 
outcompete Great Britain by 15 years, and demonstrate the manpower of
the communist country.

Between 1958 and 1960, millions of Chinese citizens 
were moved onto communes. Some were sent to 
farming cooperatives, while others worked in small 
manufacturing. Chairman Mao Zedong aimed to shift workers from
algricultural production to manufacturing sectors while also 
increasing China's output of products.

The basis of the commune system was that, agricultural and political 
decisions were decentralized, and ideological similarity rather 
than expertise was concentrated on. Everybody would share tools and tasks. 
The peasants were organized into 
brigade teams, and communal kitchens were formed so that 
women could add to the production. 

The failure of agricultural policies, the movement of farmers 
from agricultural to industrial work, and weather conditions led to 
millions of deaths from severe famine. 
The economy, which had improved since the end of the civil war, 
was devastated, and in response to the severe conditions, 
there was resistance among the people.
