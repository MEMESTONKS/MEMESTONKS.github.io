One medium-sized banana packs a whopping 
400 milligrams of potassium— nearly 10 percent of our recommended daily value!
Bananas are one of the healthiest fruits in the world because they are packed 
full of vitamins and minerals – especially potassium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. 

One medium sized banana can provide up to 33% of our recommended daily amount of 
Vitamin B6 and they are also an excellent 
source of Vitamin C – which we all know is great for our immune systems. 
Bananas also provide magnesium, Vitamin A, 
iron and copper that are essential to our overall health and wellbeing.🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌

White bread is fortified with calcium and four medium slices per day would 
provide over 30% of 
the recommended daily intake of calcium which we need every day to maintain healthy bones and teeth.
Bread, especially wholemeal, is an important source of dietary fibre which helps to keep our 
digestive system healthy, 
helps control blood sugar and cholesterol levels and makes us feel fuller for longer.
Bread is a low fat source of protein 
which is required by our bodies for growth, renewal and repair.

White bread is fortified with iron. Iron is important for energy and concentration, a healthy 
immune system and healthy blood.
Bread contains a wide range of vitamins and minerals including B group vitamins 
thiamine (B1), Niacin (B3) 
which are important for releasing energy from food and maintaining healthy skin, eyes and nails. 
It contains the B vitamin Folate (Folic Acid) which is important for pregnancy as it can help 
to prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida.🍞 🍞 🍞 🍞 🍞
