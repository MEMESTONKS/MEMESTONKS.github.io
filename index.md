**Siege of Stalingrad**

Stretching about 30 miles (50 km) along the banks of the Volga River, 
Stalingrad was a large industrial city producing armaments and tractors and was 
an important prize in itself for the invading German army. The city 
would also serve
as a important prize for Hitler, encouraging morale in Germany by capturing 
the only city by the famous dictator's name.

Hitler wanted to destroy Soviet forces in the south, take control
of the region's resources, then he would mobolize his army to take Moscow or
conquer what was left of Caucasas. The offensive would be 
undertaken by Army Group South under Field Marshal Fedor von Bock. 

After a few days of launching its attack, Germany’s air 
force had rendered the Volga River impassable to shipping and had sunk several 
Russian commercial vessels in the process. From late August through the end 
of the assault, the Luftwaffe conducted dozens of air strikes on the city.

Stalin instructed his forces in the city to ruthlessly hold their ground, 
famously decreeing in Order No. 227: “Not a step back!” Those who surrendered would 
fac possible execution. Outnumbered and without air cover, the 62nd and 64th 
Soviet Armies suffered huge casualties in the first week of fighting.
By November, the German High Command had committed 1.2 million men to the southern
front.

As the fighting reached its most brutal times, Gen. Alexander Vasilevsky 
and Gen. Georgy Zhukov came up with a proposed massive double encirclement 
of the entire 
German Sixth Army. Stalin approved their plan – Operation Uranus – on November 13.
on November 19-23 1942, Soviet forces on the northern flank of 
the Axis forces at Stalingrad began their attack. 
 
The Germans were streched too thin in the effort of capturing the city, and they relied on Romanian 
forces to protect their flanks from Soviet attacks. Although Romanian units 
succeeded in repelling the first Soviet attacks, 
by the end of 20 November the Third and Fourth Romanian armies were in 
headlong retreat, as the Red Army bypassed several German infantry divisions.

The Soviets had their troops surround 300,000 German troops of the 4th and 6th 
armies within 4 days. Instead of ordering German troops to plan a breakthrough,
Hitler demanded that supplies be carried in by air. Heavy Soviet 
anti-aircraft fire and fighter interceptions led to the loss of over 490 German transport aircraft.

Friedrich Paulus surrendered 91,000 German troops under his command on January 31, 1943.
From now on, Stalin and his Red Army would
be largely on the offensive; capturing Berlin in 1945. It was the first defeat to be publicly
acknowleged by Hitler and the turning point of World War II on the european front.
