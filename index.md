The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a 
multistage aerobic capacity test that 
progressively gets more difficult as 
it continues.

The 20-meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. 
Line up at the start.
The running speed starts slowly 
but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.

A single lap should be completed each 
time you hear this sound.
Remember to run in a straight line, 
and run as long as possible.

The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.
The test will begin on the word start.
On your mark, get ready, start.
