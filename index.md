**Operation Bagration** 
  
  The Bagration Operation was a Soviet code name for a multifront strategic 
offensive operation named after sarist general Pyotr Bagration, who had been 
killed at Borodino, fighting Napoleon’s invasion of 1812 in the war of the sixth coalition. 
(23 June–29 August 1944) during World War II on the eastern front that 
shattered the German Army Group Center.

Despite the recent Allied landing at Normandy, the German army had over 
235 divisions in the East, in comparison with a meager 85 in the West.
With Leningrad relieved in January 1944, and with nearly half of Ukraine now taken, 
the Soviets planned several offensive operations that was to ripple across the 
eastern front from north to south.

The chosen option for this offensive was an attack 
in Belorussia against Germany’s Army Group Centre, which 
was holding the ‘Belorussian Balcony’ – a salient jutting
eastwards into Soviet territory. Success here would carry the Red Army 
into Poland and, in the future, open a direct road to Berlin.

By June 1944, Germany had lost 3.3 million men, and the 
Wehrmacht was understrength by an estimated 20%. Of the 1 million men 
lost in the winter fighting in Russia, only 100,000 had been replaced. Experienced 
units could outmatch the Red Army, but there were far too few of them.

The operation would last about 2 months, from the June 22 to the August 19, 1944. 
The plan was to simultaneously batter the German major defenses at six points 
along the front line with the use of four million Soviet troops, 62,000 artillery 
guns, 7,500 tanks, and 7,100 aircraft.

Operation Bagration allowed the Soviet Union to recapture Byelorussia and 
Ukraine within its 1941 borders, advance into German East Prussia. The campaign 
enabled the next operation, the Vistula–Oder Offensive, to come within 
sight of the German capital. The Soviets were initially surprised at the success of the 
Byelorussian operation which had nearly reached Warsaw. The Soviet advance encouraged the Warsaw 
uprising against the German occupation forces.
