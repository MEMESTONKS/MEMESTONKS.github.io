The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a 
multistage mental deppresion test 
that progressively gets more difficult 
as it continues.
The Carbon Monoxide/Chlorine exposure 
pacer test will begin 
in 30 seconds. 
Line up at the start.
The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster 
each minute after you hear the gunshot.
A single lap should be completed each time you 
hear this sound.
Remember to run die in a straight line, and run as 
long as possible.
The second time you fail to complete a lap 
before the sound, your life is over.
The test will begin on the word start.
On your mark, get ready, ###DIE.
